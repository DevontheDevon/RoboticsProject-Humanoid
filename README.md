# RoboticsProject-Humanoid
Welcome to the Humanoid Robot Project repository! This project aims to develop a fully functional humanoid robot capable of performing a wide range of tasks and interactions. We believe in the power of open-source collaboration and invite passionate robotics enthusiasts, engineers, and developers to contribute to this exciting endeavor.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to design, build, and program a humanoid robot that emulates human-like movements and behaviors. The robot will feature a combination of sensors, actuators, and sophisticated control software to enable various functionalities. From walking and grasping objects to facial expressions and voice recognition, our humanoid robot will strive to push the boundaries of robotics.

How to Contribute
We encourage everyone interested in robotics to get involved and contribute to the project. Whether you have expertise in mechanical design, electronics, software development, or any related field, your contributions are valuable. Here's how you can participate:
